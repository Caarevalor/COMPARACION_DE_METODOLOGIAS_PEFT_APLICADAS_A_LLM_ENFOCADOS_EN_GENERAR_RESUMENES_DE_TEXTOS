Jess: No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;)
Lynn: Well...
Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?
Lynn: I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think?
Jess: I guess? 
Charlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream.
Jess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?
Charlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.
Lynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!

Rick: So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb??
Sean: Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. John needs a QB!
John: I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait...
Rick: Crazy it happens though! he one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. We could vote and go from there. I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar.
John: In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR  for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. I have t take my chances.
Sean: Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
Rick: people's evidence #658 why the QB rule doesn't work.
John: I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year.
