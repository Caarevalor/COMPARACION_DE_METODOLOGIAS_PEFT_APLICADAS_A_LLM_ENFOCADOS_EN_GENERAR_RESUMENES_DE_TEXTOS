### Conversation:

#Person1#:  So is there any other area I should look at as well?
#Person2#: Yes, I'd recommend West Derby. That will be closer to your office.
#Person1#:  That sounds good.
#Person2#:  Yes, and if you have children, it also has very good schools.
#Person1#:  That's not my concern. I live on my own so I'm only looking for a cheap single room, something like a flat.
#Person2#:  Umm, that may be a problem here in this area then, because there are mostly larger houses here. You'd probably be able to share one with other people who want to rent though.
#Person1#:  No, I'm only interested in flats at the moment.
#Person2#:  We actually have another office in South Derby, and the guy who works there is a really good friend of mine. His name is John Godfrey.
#Person1#:  Could you tell me his telephone number?
#Person2#:  It's 074263951.
#Person1#:  Great. Is there a good time to call him? I'm here for a whole week until Sunday tenth.
#Person2#:  I'm sure he'll be able to see you on Saturday.
#Person1#:  That sounds fine. Thanks for your help.

#Person2#: One hundred ninety countries have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but the issues are just too complex. There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.

#Person1#: I read it myself on the financial page. They're really going to join together. U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's, they will take over the company as of next month.
#Person2#: The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes. Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy?
#Person1#: I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition. If you can't beat'em, join'em.

#Person1#: Good evening and welcome to this week's Business World, the program for and about business people. Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store?
#Person2#: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want.
#Person1#: You mean you don't keep regular hours?

#Person2#: Yes. Does the checking account come with a debit card?
#Person1#: Yes. Actually, both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines, so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction.
#Person2#: That's very convenient.
#Person1#: It is. Our customers really like it. Do you have any other questions about your new accounts?
#Person2#: Yes. What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft?
#Person1#: The maximum is $ 1000.
#Person2#: Is there a penalty for having an overdraft?
#Person1#: Yes, but it's not much. You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account. It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards.
#Person2#: That's true. Is everything alright with my documents?

Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners, while they are the norm in China. Hey! Your chopsticks, old silly! You should never stab your chopsticks into the rice bowl!
#Person2#: Anything wrong with that?
#Person1#: Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate. They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices for the death. It's very inauspicious, and might enrage all present.

#Person1#: Hello, Sir, may I help you?
#Person2#: Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.
#Person1#: Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.
#Person2#: I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let's say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?
#Person1#: It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment!
#Person2#: It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.
#Person1#: That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.
#Person2#: You know what? I don't really need the money. Thanks anyways!

#Person1#: Thanks a lot Ayden. Every little bit will help. Tell you what, if you aren't doing anything tonight, why don't you come over and have dinner at my place.
#Person2#: That'd be great. Thanks! What time should I come over?

### Conversation:

#Person1#: Hi Mary, how's it going?
#Person2#: Well, last night I had a big argument with Ann.
#Person1#: Terrible. It must be something serious. You two are such close friends.
#Person2#: Now that I look back at it, it wasn't that big a deal. I shouldn't have lost my temper.
#Person1#: Really? What happened?
#Person2#: It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, and we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip. I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all.
#Person1#: That's pretty harsh.
#Person2#: I know, but I was so upset. I mean, come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says?
#Person1#: You know she probably feels just as bad.
#Person2#: Well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often.
#Person1#: Well, in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want.
#Person2#: Yeah, I'll call later to patch things up.

#Person1#: Hi, Ann, welcome back. How's your trip to the states?
#Person2#: Very busy. I had a lot of meetings. So, of course, I didn't have much time to see New York.
#Person1#: What a pity. Actually I have a trip there myself next week.
#Person2#: Do you? Then take my advice. Do the well-being in the air program. It really works.
#Person1#: Oh, I read about that in a magazine. You say it works?
#Person2#: Yes. I did the program on the flight to the States. And when I arrived in New York, I didn't have any problem. No jet leg at all. On the way back I didn't do it, and I felt terrible.
#Person1#: You are joking.
#Person2#: Not at all. It really made a lot of difference.
#Person1#: Hmm...So, what did you do?
#Person2#: Well, I didn't drink any alcohol or coffee and I didn't eat any meat or rich food. I drink a lot of water and fruit juice and I eat the meals on the well-being menu. They are lighter. They have fish, vegetables and noodles, for example. And I did some of the exercises in the program.
#Person1#: Exercises? On a plane?
#Person2#: Yes. I didn't do many, of course. There isn't much space on the plane.
#Person1#: How many passengers did the exercises?
#Person2#: Not many.
#Person1#: And how much champagne did they drink?
#Person2#: A lot. It was more popular than mineral water.
#Person1#: So, basically it's a choice. Mineral water and exercises or champagne and jet lag.

#Person2#: Well, many people think so because it's the biggest city, but it's not the capital. Quebec City is, but Montreal is great. The Santa Lawrence River runs right through the middle of the city. It's beautiful in summer.
#Person1#: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is okay, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?
#Person2#: Well, people speak both French and English there, but you'll hear French most of the time and all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world. So you'd better practice your French before you go.
#Person1#: Good advice, what about Quebec City? I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like?

#Person1#: Hi, Laura. Where are you heading with that big bag?
#Person2#: I'm off to the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know.
#Person1#: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good?

#Person2#: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself.
#Person1#: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming.

### Conversation:

#Person1#: I swear I will never shop at a street market in China. It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something.
#Person2#: cool down, Harry! What are you really mad about? Did you get ripped off?
#Person1#: yes. Last Sunday I went to a nearby market. It was on open-air fair. I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot, without even trying to strike a bargain. I paid one hundred and twenty. And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced. I could have talked my way to thirty.
#Person2#: is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals. It's the norm of free trade. The seller sets a preposterous price, and the buyer tries his best to bring it down, until a compromise is reached. Yet you ignored the process. No wonder you ended up easy prey.
#Person1#: but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?
#Person2#: of course, that's something really irritating. And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first. And then you may negotiate for a fair deal.

#Person2#: That's a good idea! So you don't need to worry about it.
#Person1#: I think so, too. What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company?
#Person2#: It's OK. You could send an email to the employer via the internet.
#Person1#: Good idea. It is convenient and fast.
#Person2#: You could inquire about the results directly, but should be politely.
#Person1#: Certainly.
#Person2#: I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly. If it's too long, I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it.
#Person1#: I think that about one hundred words are enough.
#Person2#: After you send the letter of inquiry, you should pay close attention not to miss any reply.
#Person1#: OK, I know now.

#Person1#: James, why are you watching TV? Your train leaves at 4:30. There are just 2 hours left. Have you finished packing?
#Person2#: I've almost finished packing. Now I'm waiting for the jacket I lent to David last week.
#Person1#: Which jacket, the gray one or the blue one?

#Person2#: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...
#Person1#: That's correct. If you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. Now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. First, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year. Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts. If you look at the overhead, you'll see a graph... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005, the red line is the sales in 2006...

#Person2#: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper.

#Person1#: What are the main differences between this country and your country?
#Person2#: Well, in Russia, everything happens very fast. People talk quickly, they drive their cars too fast, the good deals go by really quickly...but here in Canada, it seems like people are a little more relaxed.
#Person1#: Is that true for everything?
#Person2#: No, of course not. In Russia, going to the bank can take hours. The same is true for the post office and the supermarket. In Canada, however, these places are pretty easy to get through quickly.
#Person1#: So, what is it that makes some things go either faster or slower compared to us here in Canada? I was born and raised here, so I guess I don't notice these things. I've also never been outside the country before.
#Person2#: I think the people in Russia are fast movers by nature, at least in the big cities. Public places are still very slow because they haven't tried to do business any differently than they used to.
#Person1#: But in Canada, it's the opposite?
#Person2#: Right. The government here does a great job of solving problems and using new technology to make businesses work better. But I think Canadians are just more calm in general than Russians are... and they're definitely more relaxed than Americans!
#Person1#: Well, I agree with you about that last part!

#Person1#: You should have seen the line at the housing office. It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year. Have you made yours yet?
#Person2#: No, I'm not sure I'm going to.
#Person1#: There's not much time left. The deadline's May 1. That is just two weeks from now. Are you short of cash?
#Person2#: No, I'm Okay.
#Person1#: You'd better hurry up if you want a dorm room next September. There aren't enough rooms for every one, and first year students have priority.
#Person2#: Well, I've been thinking about living off campus.
#Person1#: Have you any idea of how much that would cost? There is the rent, utilities, and you'd probably need a car.
#Person2#: I know it would be more expensive. I think I can handle it though. The dorm is just so noisy that I can't get anything done. Maybe my grades would be better if I had some peace and quiet in a place of my own.
#Person1#: You should study in the library the way I do. Think of the money you'd save.
#Person2#: I've got to think it over some more. There's still two weeks left in April.

#Person1#: it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world.
